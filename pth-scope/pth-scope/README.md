## Description

**PTH-Scope** is an tool designed to provide a detailed analysis of `.pth` files, which are model files typically used in PyTorch for neural network training. This tool helps users to understand the architecture and parameters of neural networks, including layer count, types of layers, total parameters, file size, and inferred architecture.

## How to Use

1. **Starting the Application:** Launch PTH-Scope by running the script.
2. **Uploading Files:** Click on the 'Upload .PTH File' button to select the `.pth` file you wish to analyze.
3. **Analyzing the File:** After selecting the file, the tool will process it and display information such as the layer count, total parameters, file size, main layers, and shapes of the first and last layers.
4. **Viewing the Results:** The results will be displayed in a structured text format, providing insights into the neural network's architecture and complexity.
5. **Interpreting the Data:** The results are presented in an easy-to-understand manner. Review the data to gain insights into the neural network's design and parameters.
6. **Error Handling:** In case of any errors, such as incompatible file formats or corrupt files, the tool will display an error message, guiding you to troubleshoot.

Feel free to upload different `.pth` files to explore the capabilities of PTH-Scope and deepen your understanding of neural network architectures.
